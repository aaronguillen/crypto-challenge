# crypto-challenge
I made this a while back (October 1st, 2014, actually) when I was trying to do freelance work for a shady guy who didn't pay me for it. It was fun though, here it is.

The two files Guillen_Aaron_CTF_Crypto.py and Guillen_Aaron_CTF_Crypto_Complete.py are the files as I originally wrote them back in 2014. I was using Python 2.7.6, so I wasn't able to run those files to test if they worked.

I'm now using Python 3.4.0, so I did a little light editting, and that's where you get the file Guillen_Aaron_CTF_Crypto_Editted_2016.py
